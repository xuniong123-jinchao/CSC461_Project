## Introduction

## Background

Carplay technology is an Apple standard to allow user's IPhone to connect to your car stereo, which acts like a controller and demonstrated as a IOS operation like display. A Carplay stereo gives user access to IPhone's calling, music, mapping and message applications with a simple one-cord connection to user's IPhone using the phone's Lighting-to-USB cable or wireless.[1] This gives user a  full range of features that go-hand-in-hand with driving, or better yet, go hands free with driving.[2]

## History

Many automobile manufacturers have been building Carplay support into cars since 2015, but there's also a way to get Carplay in existing vehicles -- many aftermarket in-dash systems from Sony, Pioneer, Kenwood, and Alpine are compatible with Carplay and are readily available at reasonable prices. More than 400 vehicles manfacturers are coming out with Carplay support all the time.[3] As of late 2016, CarPlay is available in hundreds of cars, with manufacturers like Cadillac, Chevrolet, Fiat-Chrysler, Ford (all 2016 and 2017 models), GMC, Honda, Kia, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Volvo, Nissan, BMW, Hyundai, Porsche, Toyota, Volkswagen, and more offering CarPlay-equipped vehicles that are available now. Even semi trucks are gaining CarPlay support, with Volvo introducing its first CarPlay-equipped VNL series trucks, and Honda has introduced the first motorcycle with CarPlay support.[2]

Apple has created an official master list of all the CarPlay vehicles available in the United States and other countries. For those in search of a CarPlay-equipped vehicle, Apple's list is the best way to determine the options that are available. It is updated on a regular basis to add new models, but may not include new CarPlay vehicles as soon as they are announced.[3] For that reason, the CarPlay Timeline at the bottom of this roundup is also a good resource for finding news on CarPlay vehicles as soon as they're announced.

Apple's list includes over 400 new 2016, 2017, and 2018 models from more than 20 vehicle manufacturers, and additional automobile manufacturers are adding support on a regular basis.[3]
