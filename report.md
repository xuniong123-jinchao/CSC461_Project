## Background

Carplay technology is an Apple standard to allow user's IPhone to connect to your car stereo, which acts like a controller and demonstrated as a IOS operation like display. A Carplay stereo gives user access to IPhone's calling, music, mapping and message applications with a simple one-cord connection to user's IPhone using the phone's Lighting-to-USB cable or wireless.[1]
