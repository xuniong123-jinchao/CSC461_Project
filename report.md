## Introduction

Carplay technology is an Apple standard to allow user's IPhone to connect to your car stereo, which acts like a controller and demonstrated as a IOS operation like display. A Carplay stereo gives user access to IPhone's calling, music, mapping and message applications with a simple one-cord connection to user's IPhone using the phone's Lighting-to-USB cable or wireless.[1] This gives user a  full range of features that go-hand-in-hand with driving, or better yet, go hands free with driving.
