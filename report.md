# Introduction and Research

## Background

Carplay technology is an Apple standard to allow user's IPhone to connect to your car stereo, which acts like a controller and demonstrated as a IOS operation like display. A Carplay stereo gives user access to IPhone's calling, music, mapping and message applications with a simple one-cord connection to user's IPhone using the phone's Lighting-to-USB cable or wireless.[1] This gives user a  full range of features that go-hand-in-hand with driving, or better yet, go hands free with driving.[2]

## History

Many automobile manufacturers have been building Carplay support into cars since 2015, but there's also a way to get Carplay in existing vehicles -- many aftermarket in-dash systems from Sony, Pioneer, Kenwood, and Alpine are compatible with Carplay and are readily available at reasonable prices. More than 400 vehicles manfacturers are coming out with Carplay support all the time.[3] As of late 2016, CarPlay is available in hundreds of cars, with manufacturers like Cadillac, Chevrolet, Fiat-Chrysler, Ford (all 2016 and 2017 models), GMC, Honda, Kia, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Volvo, Nissan, BMW, Hyundai, Porsche, Toyota, Volkswagen, and more offering CarPlay-equipped vehicles that are available now. Even semi trucks are gaining CarPlay support, with Volvo introducing its first CarPlay-equipped VNL series trucks, and Honda has introduced the first motorcycle with CarPlay support.[2]

Apple has created an official master list of all the CarPlay vehicles available in the United States and other countries. For those in search of a CarPlay-equipped vehicle, Apple's list is the best way to determine the options that are available. It is updated on a regular basis to add new models, but may not include new CarPlay vehicles as soon as they are announced.[3] For that reason, the CarPlay Timeline at the bottom of this roundup is also a good resource for finding news on CarPlay vehicles as soon as they're announced.

Apple's list includes over 400 new 2016, 2017, and 2018 models from more than 20 vehicle manufacturers, and additional automobile manufacturers are adding support on a regular basis.[3]

## User Case Analysis

### Customize the Carplay Screen

Users can customize the CarPlay screen by moving popular third-party apps to the main screen or even hiding some of the default apps. It's actually quite easy, and you can do it anytime on your iPhone -- even when you don't have CarPlay active.

First, go into your iPhone's Settings app. This is the app with the gears turning.
Next, scroll down and tap General.
In the General settings, choose CarPlay. 
Users should see your car listed on this screen. Tap your car for settings specific to it.[3]
The car settings contain a virtual CarPlay screen. You can move apps around this screen just as you would on an iPhone: tap and hold to 'pick up' an app and keep your finger down on the display while moving it. To drop an app, just lift your finger.
Users can move an app from one page of apps to another page by dragging it to the very left or right edge of the virtual CarPlay's screen and then pausing while the screen flips to the new page.[5]
You can also hide an app by tapping the minus sign on the icon. This moves it to a menu of hidden apps just below the virtual CarPlay screen. You can add it back again by simply tapping it.

### Voice control using Siri

Carplay have the ability to use Siri hands-free when driving, and can be done in one or two ways. One way is to use the Voice control button on the steering wheel of most, to hold the button until the users can hear the sound of Siri. Those using an aftermarket installation, or those that simply don’t want to hold a button to activate Siri, can use ‘Hey Siri’ on the iPhone to activate the virtual assistant, although results tend to be hit and miss if the environment is loud (car engine, music, etc). It’s also limited to newer iPhones (iPhone 6s and 6s Plus or newer).[4]

Siri voice control can be used for navigation, read/send text and browse for music. Siri can also help users make calls on the go without distracting users from the road. Simply say “Call someone/name” or “return my last call” and Siri will handle the rest. In fact, users can even get it to play back recent voicemails if users ask it to. Meanwhile, these options are also available via the CarPlay dashboard in the Phone app, but it’s not recommended that users interact with the touchscreen while driving.[4]

## Summary

Carplay is always said to be less disstracting for drivers than other system now on the current market. According to the user-side design and convenient functions search, Carplay suppose to be user-friendly and Apple relevant still tried to improve it in the latest IOS 13 update. The next section will search for reseach about Carplay disstracting tests, such as the time used for each function of Carplay during driving by different operations, and the comparsion between Carplay, Andriod Auto and other car-inner operation systems of some automobiile manufacturers.
