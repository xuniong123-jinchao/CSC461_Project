#### What is the project topic, and why is it important?
CarPlay is an Apple standard that allows drivers use a limited number of apps on their iPhones safely while driving. Such apps are adapted to be manipulated by built-in touch screens, voice controls, knobs, and buttons. CarPlay is available on selected car models of many popular brands, and iPhones can be connected to Carplay via USB cord or bluetooth/Wi-Fi. In this project, we will discuss and evaluate part of the design disciplines of CarPlay apps, protocols & APIs, connection & transmission methods, and its effects on driving safety.

The lifespans of native multimedia entertainment and navigation systems on vehicles are much less than which of the vehicles themselves. With CarPlay, for instance, one can always let the navigation maps be up-to-date. CarPlay provides simplified control, like log-in free access, Siri voice control, and minimizing the number of steps to achieve certain tasks, which ensures the eyes are on the road as much as possible. CarPlay is also compatible with on-vehicle settings, via using automakers apps, to do tasks as changing the climate and loading driver profiles.

#### What has been found by us, and why are they not sufficient?
According to a research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, Apple CarPlay and Googleâ€™s Android Auto are less distracting to drivers when compared to built-in vehicle infotainment systems designed by automakers. As the statistics in the research, when the drivers are performing some complex tasks, CarPlay can be 24% (5 seconds) faster on average for making calls, and 31% (15 seconds) faster for programming navigations. We have also looked at the human interface guidelines from Apple for CarPlay developers, which ensures apps deliver functionalities in similar visual styles, and they are at the minimum levels of distraction (e.g. reduce the usages of notification). 

What we should explore further are something more in technical aspects, such as things needed to keep iPhones and vehicle head units in synchronization. We have found web pages and articles about the APIs provided by Apple and protocols to set up and switch between wired and wireless (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) connections.
